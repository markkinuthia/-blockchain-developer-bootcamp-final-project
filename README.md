# Decentralizing contract managment in corporate law 






## Background and Motivation 

<p>Modern contracts are very long and complex . Contracts have a defined structure with changes being effected through adding or removing clauses .
This poses a challenge especially for huge corporations e.g(Banks,governments ,public institutions and multinationals) . They often have corporate
clients in the thousands and in multiple jurisdictions . Deal negotiations become very complicated especially with the back and forth of clause changes 
in these contracts . It also becomes a hectic undertaking to audit the changes and final agreement on a contract , making the whole process prone to 
errors . These misunderstandings might bring about litigation.</p>

## Goals 
1. Create a blockchain for contract management and storage.
2. Using ERC-721 we can track a specific contract and give it distinction.
3. We can also give it basic functionality and track transfer and clause changes on the same contract -> According to law when you are using a contract 
  for legal proceedings you are supposed to assume that you have the same document over the entire duration of the agreement i.e(1 year, 5years, 20 years 
  100 years for leases) in this case that assumption becomes literal , because you have the same document and it can be verifed as so .
4. ERC - 721 also has the functionality of consignment to third party i.e (Brokers , respondents ) adding to its suitablility 
5.
