# Decentralizing management of Legal Documents using Semi-Fungible tokens 






## Background and Motivation 

<p>Modern contracts are very long and complex . Contracts have a defined structure with changes being effected through adding or removing clauses .
This poses a challenge especially for huge corporations e.g(Banks,governments ,public institutions and multinationals) . They often have corporate
clients in the thousands and in multiple jurisdictions . Deal negotiations become very complicated especially with the back and forth of clause changes 
in these contracts . It also becomes a hectic undertaking to audit the changes and final agreement on a contract , making the whole process prone to 
errors . These misunderstandings might bring about litigation.</p>

## Goals 
1. Create a blockchain for contract management and storage.
2. Using ERC-721 we can track a specific contract and give it distinction.
3. We can also give it basic functionality and track transfer and clause changes on the same contract -> According to law when you are using a contract 
  for legal proceedings you are supposed to assume that you have the same document over the entire duration of the agreement i.e(1 year, 5years, 20 years 
  100 years for leases) in this case that assumption becomes literal , because you have the same document and it can be verifed as so .
4. ERC - 721 also has the functionality of consignment to third party i.e (Brokers , respondents ) adding to its suitablility 
5. </p>

  

## Semi-Fungibility 

Fungibility is based on the premise of a good being interchangeable . Fungible ~ (of goods contracted for without an individual specimen being specified) able to 
replace or be replaced by another identical item; mutually interchangeable.
I want my legal document to be the same document despite any changes in clauses that might occur , this presents us with a challenge , because once a change
is made to a legal document logically this is a different contract because I have added or removed clauses but legally this is the same contract with **modifications**.
We want our contracts to be semi-fungible , but what does that mean ?
I have tried to search for the meaning of semi-fungibility and came across the below pictorial on opensea

Taking the ticket example as a point of reference , the same way a ticket holder had various seat options on the day of purchase is the same way contract parties have 
various positions to take during finalizing of a contract agreement . This would mean that in the course of the contract if the position of one of the party changes , they 
have to all go back to the initial contract and negotiate to introduce a clause that represents the change in their position . in the ticket example this would mean issuing 
a new ticket with only the seat number being changed , for the contract this would mean making a modification to the contract and sharing it with all parties .
